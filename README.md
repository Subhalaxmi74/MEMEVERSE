To see the application in action, watch the demo video:

### Option 1: Local Video File
If you have a local video file, place it inside your project (e.g., `assets/demo.mp4`) and reference it:
```markdown
[Download the Demo Video](assets/demo.mp4)
```

### Option 2: Embedded Video (If Supported)
If your markdown viewer supports HTML, you can embed the video directly:

<video width="600" controls>
    <source src="assets/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
